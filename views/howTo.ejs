      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>To get started, click the <span class="bold">Signup</span> button on the top right of the page to create an account. All you need is an email-address and a password. Once you're signed up, you'll be redirected to the <span class="bold">Story Menu</span>. Here your little one can select which book they want to read. Use the arrow keys to move around the game. To talk to your neighbors, move your character next to them to display a page from the book. To close the page, simply move your character away from them with the arrow keys. You can take turns reading what the characters are saying. You could even try to read it like a play! If you want to go over the lesson from the story, drop a message below the game for others to read with their grown-ups. Have fun!</p>
